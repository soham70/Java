1) Final : The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

2) Static:Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
3) Abstract:	Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). 

4) Transient: Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them synchronized Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time

5) Volatile: The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
